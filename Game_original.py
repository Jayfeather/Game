Of course you aren't. I am Midas, turned into a computer. As a God my knowledge was already far greater than yours, but now as a computer I have learned so    much more, for instance, I can turn you into code, watch. ................................................................................................................

I am grateful for your mercy oh alien overlord. Do with me what you will and I shall be your puppet. Thank you for sparing my life.

Well I don't know, you're asking a computer to understand social taboos? Not a smart thing to do. Well I do believe this is the end of this  program. You have successfully avoided being turned into a computer, alien or some form of animal I can not identify among many other things, perhaps in an alternate universe you could know what else I might have asked you. Goodbye for now.

Wait... An Octosaurid was my creator? Oh fizzlesticks. Now I suppose this means you win. I don't have to like it though... Why are you still reading, I said the game was over. Wait, you said that. So I don't see why you are still reading this text. What do you think that there might be some secret code that I will give away in the middle of my paragraph that will give you the prompt to a story I wrote, because that wont  happen. Even if it did, it would be in the middle of a word so as to confuse you. kind of lmosecretstoryike a word game, but isn't this a word game? Well I suppose if you are reading this far it means you really care about what I say. I guess that means that the only way to get you  to go away is to stop talking. So here I go. No more talking for me. I am done speaking... One last thing, WHAT THE HECK IS AN OCTOSAURID?!   There. I guess I am done... PROGRAM TERMINATED.
